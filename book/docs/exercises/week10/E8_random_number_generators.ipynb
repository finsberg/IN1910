    "We have seen that RANDU reproduces the mean and the variance of its distribution, which is good. However, there are other statistical properties it also needs to follow. One of these is that different samples from the distribution, i.e., different generated numbers, should be *uncorrelated*. It turns out that RANDU breaks this requirement, horribly. This is very briefly shown in L17.\n",

    "A common way to show how bad RANDU actually is, is to plot random points within a three dimensional unit cube. A unit cube is a cube with sides that goes from 0 to 1 in all three dimensions. We can place a randomly located point inside the cube by drawing three random numbers in the $[0, 1)$ range, one for each of the three coordinates $x$, $y$ and $z$. If all three coordinates are chosen randomly *and* independent of each other, the random point will have an equal likelihood of landing anywhere within the cube. For RANDU however, if we plot this out, we see that these \"random\" points aren't distributed uniformly throughout the cube at all, but rather all land in specific planes. Let us produce such a plot.\n",

If you are plotting inside Jupyter you can use `ax.view_init(elevation, method)` before you show the plot. For example `view_init(30, 60)` should be a good angle. At least for me.\n",
