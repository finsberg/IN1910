    "We have now implemented a function that finds the $n$'th Fibonnaci number, which is great. However, it is very inefficient. Imagine for example we want to compute $F_{100}$. The first call to the function, creates two new calls: `F(99)` and `F(98)`. Both of these call the function twice again, so we have four function calls there. Each of those four lead to two new ones and so on all the way down to the base case of $n=1$. This means we make something on the order of $2^{100}$ function calls! This means the complexity of calulating $F(n)$ grows exponentially as $n$ grows, which is horrible. Try drawing a tree to represent the function calls for $n=100$ and you quickly see the absurdity of the situation.\n",
