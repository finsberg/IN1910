# Week 6

This week, we start looking at a new programming language, C++. In these exercises, you will get a chance to solve some exercises using this new language. As the goal is to get you familiarized with the C++ syntax, and how to compile and run the programs, the exercises themselves are not that technical.

If you have not set up your computer for C++ programming yet, have a look at the [Setup guide](../../setup/cpp_compiler.md).
To refresh the basic concepts about C++, we refer to the notes at [An introduction to C++](../../lectures/cpp/intro_to_cpp.md).
