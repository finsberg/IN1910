# Building a data visualization app with streamlit

When working with data, having a way to interactively explore your dataset is often essential in order to understand and interpret the data. Futhermore, interactive visualizations is a great way to communicate with non-technical people about the main findings.

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks is great tool to explore the data, and with the help of for example [widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) you can also make pretty nice interactive visualizations with jupyter notebooks. That said, jupyter notebooks still require some level of programming. Futhermore, the code you need to write in order to make visualizations in a jupyter notebook will til be visible within the notebook. These code block might contain a lot of details that might disturb the people that need to make decisions about the data and therefore it would be advantageous to present the data in a format that is both interactive and that hides details about the implementation.

## Tools for building interactive data visualizations
Several tools have been made for creating interactive data visualizations. One example is [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) which is built on top of the plotting library called [Plotly](https://plotly.com). Another popular choice is [Voil√†](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which basically takes a jupyter notebook and turns it into a web application.

We will take a closer look at library called [streamlit](https://streamlit.io)


## Streamlit

Before we can use `streamlit` we need to install it. This can be done using pip, i.e
```text
python -m pip install streamlit
```
For more info about installing `streamlit` please consult the [installation instructions](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation).

Once installed you should have access to a command line script called streamlit. Running
```text
$ streamlit --version
```
should display the version of `streamlit`. The one used at the time of writing is version 1.13.0.
You can also display a help menu by running `streamlit` with the `--help` flag.
```text
$ streamlit --help
Usage: streamlit [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Try out a demo with:

      $ streamlit hello

  Or use the line below to run your own script:

      $ streamlit run your_script.py

Options:
  --log_level [error|warning|info|debug]
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  activate  Activate Streamlit by entering your email.
  cache     Manage the Streamlit cache.
  config    Manage Streamlit's config settings.
  docs      Show help in browser.
  hello     Runs the Hello World script.
  help      Print this help message.
  run       Run a Python script, piping stderr to Streamlit.
  version   Print Streamlit's version number.
```

You can try out the built-in demo using
```
$ streamlit hello

  Welcome to Streamlit. Check out our demo in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.0.98:8501

  Ready to create your own Python apps super quickly?
  Head over to https://docs.streamlit.io

  May you create awesome apps!

```
We see that streamlit will start a web-server running on port 8501. In other words, if you open a web browser (e.g Google Chrome or FireFox), and go to the url ` http://localhost:8501`.
It should look similar to the figure below

### A web app to explore Heart failure Data

We will use a [real dataset with heart failure data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) and create a web application to explore this dataset using `streamlit`. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) which contains a large collection of open source datasets which are used in competitions to create Machine learning models. The nice thing about this dataset is that many people have already [submitted their analysis of this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/code?datasetId=1582403&sortBy=voteCount) which you can take a look at if you want to learn how to analyze such datasets.

We can download this dataset and read it with pandas (to download it you need to first create an account at Kaggle) and print some info about this dataset.
```{code-cell} python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")
df.info()
```
We can also use the `.describe` method to display some simple statistics about the dataset
```{code-cell} python
df.describe()
```

#### Creating the first page with streamlit
Let us start by creating a very simple application with `streamlit`. Create a file called `app.py` with the following content
```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Heart Failure Prediction Dataset")
st.text("This is a web app to allow exploration of Heart failure Data")
```
Try to the python file using the following command
```
streamlit run app.py
```
A browser should open automatically (if not you can open a browser and go to the url <http://localhost:8502>).
Try to change the text in the python file, refresh the browser and see that the changes take affect.

Let us try to add some more content to the application, by adding the following lines that describe the dataset that we will explore.
```python
st.header("Dataset")
st.markdown(
    """
This dataset is taken from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

At Kaggle, several authors publish their own code where they
have analyzed the different datasets.

For example, the following review https://www.kaggle.com/code/durgancegaur/a-guide-to-any-classification-problem/notebook
is a pretty good one.
"""
)
```


#### Loading the data

We now want to load the data into the application. We can do this by reading the `.csv` file into a `pandas.DataFrame` and let us also write the statistics to to the application by adding the following lines
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")

st.header("Statistics of Dataframe")
st.write(df.describe())
```
Your app should now look similar to the following figure
```{figure} ../../figures/streamlit_first_page.png
---
width: 700px
name: streamlit_first_page
alt: streamlit_first_page
---
Current version of the web application
```

#### Creating a sidebar

A the moment we have all information on one single page. If would be nice if we could create separate pages with separate information. For example, we can now make one page called about (which could be the landing page) that contains information about the dataset, and then we could have one page for the data summary.

One way to achieve this is to create a sidebar with radio buttons that can be used to switch between pages.
We can add a sidebar to the web app by adding the following line
```python
st.sidebar.title("Navigation")
```
Here we also gave a title of *Navigation*. We can also add radio buttons with two options to the sidebar as follows
```python
options = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Select what you want to display:",
    [
        "About",
        "Data Summary",
    ],
)
print(options)
```
Here we get the selected option from the radio button in the `options` variable and to begin with we can just print the value of this to the console.

Try to refresh your application and make sure that the correct option is printed to the console when you change the value of the radio button.

#### Creating different pages

Now we would like to have different pages appearing when clicking on the different radio buttons. We can do this by having an if test at the end of the script and run a different function based on the value of `options`. For example

```python
if options == "About":
    show_about_page()
elif options == "Data Summary":
    show_data_summary_page()
elif options == "Data Header":
    show_data_header_page()
```
and then we can wrap the about page and data summary into separate functions. Here we have also added a page to show the head of the dataframe

The full code currently looks as follows

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.title("Heart Failure Prediction Dataset")
st.text("This is a web app to allow exploration of Heart failure Data")


def show_about_page():
    st.header("Dataset")
    st.markdown(
        """
    This dataset is taken from
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

    At Kaggle, several authors publish their own code where they
    have analyzed the different datasets.

    For example, the following review https://www.kaggle.com/code/durgancegaur/a-guide-to-any-classification-problem/notebook
    is a pretty good one.
    """
    )


df = pd.read_csv("heart.csv")


def show_data_summary_page():
    st.header("Statistics of Dataframe")
    st.write(df.describe())


def show_data_header_page():
    st.header("Header of Dataframe")
    st.write(df.head())


st.sidebar.title("Navigation")
options = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Select what you want to display:",
    [
        "About",
        "Data Summary",
        "Data Header",
    ],
)
if options == "About":
    show_about_page()
elif options == "Data Summary":
    show_data_summary_page()
elif options == "Data Header":
    show_data_header_page()
```

You should now be able to change the page using the radio buttons.

```


#### Plotting with matplotlib

Being able to plot the data will give another way of exploring the data. Most people are most familiar with `matplotlib` so we will start with creating som simple visualizations of the data using that. Later we will look at another visualization library called `plotly` which are better suited for creating interactive visualizations.

In order to use `matplotlib` we would need to first import it
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
To make things simple, let us assume that we want to plot maximum heart rate as a function of age. We can create such as plot using the following code snippet

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x=df["Age"], y=df["MaxHR"])
ax.grid()
ax.set_xlabel("Age")
ax.set_ylabel("MaxHR")
```

In order to display this in the web application we need to pass the `matplotlib` figure into a streamlit. We do this using the `pyplot` method in `streamlit`.
We can wrap this code into a new function called `plot_mpl`

```python
def plot_mpl():
    st.header("Plot of Data")

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter(x=df["Age"], y=df["MaxHR"])
    ax.grid()
    ax.set_xlabel("Age")
    ax.set_ylabel("MaxHR")

    st.pyplot(fig)
```

and we can create a new page called `"Scatter Plot"` that we can select in the sidebar

```python
options = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Select what you want to display:",
    [
        "About",
        "Data Summary",
        "Data Header",
        "Scatter Plot",
    ],
)

if options == "About":
    about()
elif options == "Data Summary":
    data_summary(df)
elif options == "Data Header":
    data_header(df)
elif options == "Scatter Plot":
    plot_mpl(df)
```

```{figure} ../../figures/streamlit_mpl.png

alt: streamlit_mpl

Plotting with matplotlib
```

#### Plotting with plotly express

`matplotlib` is great for plotting, and especially useful for creating figures for reports. However, there are other libraries that are better suited for interactive visualizations. One of these libraries are [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) which is built on top of a javascript library called [`plotly.js`](https://plotly.com/javascript/). Here we will use a subpackage of `plotly` called `plotly.express` which is a simplified version of the `plotly` library.

To use `plotly.express` we need to first import it, and it is common to import it as `px`
```python
import plotly.express as px
```
Before we start plotting anything, let us create a new page in our web application. In this example we would like to plot the distribution of a single column as a histogram. This can be useful order to e.g see what are the ages of the people included in this study.

Let us create a new method called `single_column` where we can start with simple writing some text, e.g
```python
def single_column():
    st.header("Single column")
```
and then we add a new option to the sidebar
```python
options = st.sidebar.radio(
    "Select what you want to display:",
    [
        "About",
        "Data Summary",
        "Data Header",
        "Scatter Plot",
        "Single column",
    ],
)
```
and finally an `if`-test to call this method in
```python
if options == "About":
    show_about_page()
elif options == "Data Summary":
    show_data_summary_page()
elif options == "Data Header":
    show_data_header_page()
elif options == "Scatter Plot":
    plot_mpl()
elif options == "Single column":
    single_column()
```
You should now see a new radio button in the sidebar saying *Single column* and when clicked will show the text *Single column*.

##### Creating a histogram

We can create a histogram over all the ages by passing in the dataframe and the key `"Age"` to the `histogram` function in `plotly.express` as follows
```python
plot = px.histogram(df, x="Age")
```
To add this plot to streamlit we can use the `plotly_chart` function
```
st.plotly_chart(plot)
```
After adding these to lines of code to the function `single_column`, you should see a histogram over all the ages in the dataset

```{figure} ../../figures/streamlit_px_hist.png
---
width: 500px
name: streamlit_px_hist
alt: streamlit_px_hist
---
Plotting histogram of all the ages using plotly express.
```

##### Adding selectbox to select different columns
Currently, we have hardcoded in the key `"Age"` as the column to be used in the histogram. However, this is not very robust and not very flexible. In stead we would like the user to be able to select any of the columns in the dataset.

One way to do this is to create a selectbox in `streamlit` and set the options to the columns in the `DataFrame`
```python
column = st.selectbox("Select column", options=df.columns)
```
now instead of passing the the column `"Age"` we can pass in the column we selected using the selectbox
```python
plot = px.histogram(df, x=column, use_container_width=True)
```
Here we have also set `use_container_width=True` so that the figure scales properly width the width of the application.
You should now be able to select a column, and the plot should update accordingly


```{figure} ../../figures/streamlit_px_select.png
---
width: 500px
name: streamlit_px_select
alt: streamlit_px_select
---
Plotting histogram with selectbox using plotly express.
```

##### Plotting two columns

Plotting a histogram of one column is useful, but it is also useful to plot one column against another (such as the scatter plot with plotted with `matplotlib`). Now that we have learned how to create a select box, it should be no problem to create two select boxes in order to select the data to be plotted on the X- and Y-axis.

Let us create a now radio button with the label *Two columns*  and a corresponding function `two_columns` with the following content
```python
def two_columns():
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    x_axis_val = col1.selectbox("Select the X-axis", options=df.columns)
    y_axis_val = col2.selectbox("Select the Y-axis", options=df.columns)

    plot_type = st.selectbox("Select plot type", options=["scatter", "box"])

    if plot_type == "scatter":
        plot = px.scatter(df, x=x_axis_val, y=y_axis_val)
    elif plot_type == "box":
        plot = px.box(df, x=x_axis_val, y=y_axis_val)

    st.plotly_chart(plot, use_container_width=True)
```
Here we first create two select boxes for the columns to be plotted on the X- and Y-axis. Then we create another selectbox where the user can select the type of plot the user wants to display (i.e either a scatter plot or a box plot), and finally we plot the data and add the plot to streamlit.

### Final code

Below you will see the final code of the whole web application. Here we also updated the functions to take the dataframe as an argument which makes it more explicit what data is used.

```python
# app.py

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

import plotly.express as px

st.set_page_config(layout="wide")

    plot_type = st.selectbox("Select plot type", options=["scatter", "box"])

    if plot_type == "scatter":
        plot = px.scatter(df, x=x_axis_val, y=y_axis_val)
    elif plot_type == "box":
        plot = px.box(df, x=x_axis_val, y=y_axis_val)

    st.plotly_chart(plot, use_container_width=True)

        "Data Header",
        "Scatter Plot",
        "Single column",
        "Two columns",
