# IN1910 â€“ Programming with Scientific Applications

This repository is meant for sharing teaching materials, info and exercises for the course IN1910, for the fall semester 2023.

General information about the course can be found on the [course site](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1910/h22/index.html), and we will publish some messages there. However, most information will be shared directly through the course repository here on Github.


This course can be seen as a follow up to IN1900 and continues the the introduction into the world of scientific programming. We will focus on teaching you important tools and concepts, and the goal is for you to walk away from the course as a competent scientific programmer.

There is also an experimental interactive version of this site that uses [jupyter-lite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at <https://finsberg.github.io/IN1910/lite>
